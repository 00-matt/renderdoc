**IF YOU DO NOT FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES, YOUR ISSUE WILL BE CLOSED**

Guide to filing issues: https://github.com/baldurk/renderdoc/blob/v1.x/docs/CONTRIBUTING/Filing-Issues.md

I'm happy to help fix bugs and discuss new features, but you have the responsibility to ensure I fully understand what you want and have the information I need to work on it. If you're _at all_ unsure of what is needed, please read the guide above for full information on what is expected for filing issues.

Delete this section when you know what to do and fill out the template below. If you do not, your issue will be closed because you clearly didn't read this!

## Description

<!--

Here you can enter a description of either the bug that you are encountering, or the feature/improvement you'd like to see happen.

-->

## Repro steps

<!--

If you're only requesting a feature you can delete this section.

For bug reports please describe the steps you can take to show the bug, in a way that I can follow them.

If you are able to share a capture, or your application, PLEASE DO THAT NOW because that is by far the easiest way to show a bug. If you cannot share because of privacy or other reasons, please say that and give as much extra information as you can.

<!-- if you are running a nightly build, list the date or commit hash for the version -->
