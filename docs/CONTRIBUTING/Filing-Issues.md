# Filing issues

Thanks for taking the time to look at the guidelines for filing issues! I'm happy to help out with your issue, but badly formatted or poorly described bug reports take too much time to untangle so it's your responsibility to give me the best possible chance to know what I need to fix.

This document is mostly split into two parts - first for bug reports, and second for feature requests or general questions.

As a general rule for all issues: Please be aware that RenderDoc is a tool for debugging your programs, not for copyright infringement. If your problem or request relates to violating copyright by extracting assets or injecting into copyrighted applications that are not your own then you will find no help here.
